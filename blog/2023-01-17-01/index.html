Over the past few months I’ve gotten into higher-end audio equipment in the hopes of enhancing my music listening experience.</p><p>I decided to jump in with a pair of Grado SR80x headphones and they’ve been phenomenal. Don’t let their design or price fool you, these guys pack a punch.</p><figure><a href="SR80x_front_full.JPG"> <img alt="A pair of Grado SR80x headphones sitting flat on a dark table" src="SR80x_front_mini.JPG" width="800"> </a><figcaption>My pair of SR80x headphones</figcaption></figure><p>Many people in audio forums will tell you that Grado headphones have a lot of high end and are very revealing… and they’re right. They’re also a ton of fun. I could sit here and list specifications and use cases at you, but <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.rtings.com/headphones/reviews/grado/sr80e-sr80" target="_blank">rtings</a> can do that better than I can.</p><p>For the price, they deliver a surprisingly neutral sound except for the high end. Prepare for cymbals and trumpets to be piercing, almost to the point of pain.</p><p>Don’t mistake that anecdote for a dislike; it’s a new way of hearing your music. If every headphone was perfectly flat and neutral then there would be no variety and I would be sad. The SR80x has a little bit of everything, and some strong opinions to boot.</p><figure><a href="SR80x_left_close_full.JPG"> <img alt="The left speaker " src="SR80x_left_close_mini.JPG" width="800"> </a><figcaption>The outside casings kind of look like tires if you squint</figcaption></figure><p>Jazz music sounds phenomenal <em>because</em> it leans into the instruments that dominate the genre. Rock music sounds muddy and shallow because the bass is nowhere to be found. That’s to say that they fit certain genres of music very well, others not so much.</p><p>Wearing them is nice because they weigh nothing and just float on your head when bent properly. Yes, I said bent. The padded headband encompasses a spring steel sheet that you bend to fit the shape of your head. When properly fitted, the speakers gently rest on your ears.</p><figure><a href="SR80x_exposed_speaker_full.JPG"> <img alt="A pair of Grado SR80x headphones with the left ear pad removed" src="SR80x_exposed_speaker_mini.JPG" width="800"> </a><figcaption>The design is... different</figcaption></figure><p>Other buyers have complained of the headphones being built cheaply, but I really like the design. They feel extremely utilitarian and purpose built for sitting down and enjoying music. They’re not super comfortable, and that’s not for everyone, but then again the whole package just works for me.</p><p>When you remove the ear pads you can shine a light through the headphones, they’re that open. The openness of the speaker back makes the sound stage feel wide and immersive. They also take almost no power to drive; even my little brick phone can do it without a sweat.</p><p>As a music enjoyment device, these headphones are truly something special that has to be experienced.</p><p>The final thing to note is that Grado Labs, the makers of these headphones, are super cool. They’re based in Brooklyn, New York and have been family run for 50+ years. They’re hand built in New York which is something special in the age of globalization. They arrive in a minimalist box with shaped foam to keep them safe in transit. No frills. The box has a thank you note and the headphones themselves.</p><p>The best part is they don’t advertize. Fans (like me) do that for them because they’re just that unique. I didn’t really know what I was getting into with these headphones, but they’re so much fun that it just pulled me deeper into the hobby.</p></main><div class="dark-mode-buttons"><button class="dark-mode-button dark-mode-hide" id="dark-mode-disable-button"><img alt="Dark mode" aria-label="dark mode toggle" title="Dark mode" height="24" src="https://www.mattnewcomer.org/dark_mode.svg" width="24"></button><button class="dark-mode-button dark-mode-show" id="dark-mode-enable-button"><img alt="Light mode" aria-label="light mode toggle" title="Light mode" height="24" src="https://www.mattnewcomer.org/light_mode.svg" width="24"></button></div><script>const cls=document.body.classList;const getSessionTheme=sessionStorage.getItem("theme");if(getSessionTheme==="dark"){cls.toggle("dark-mode",true)}else if(getSessionTheme==="light"){cls.toggle("dark-mode",false)}else if(window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches){cls.toggle("dark-mode",true)};document.getElementById("dark-mode-disable-button").addEventListener("click",function(a){cls.toggle("dark-mode",true);sessionStorage.setItem("theme","dark")});document.getElementById("dark-mode-enable-button").addEventListener("click",function(a){cls.toggle("dark-mode",false);sessionStorage.setItem("theme","light")})</script><noscript><style>.dark-mode-buttons{display:none}</style></noscript></body></html>
