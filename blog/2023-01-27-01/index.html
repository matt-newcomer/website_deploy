I’m not here to extoll the virtues of music, but I <em><strong>am</strong></em> here to tell you why Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube Music can all kick rocks.</p><h2 id="service-lock-in">Service Lock-in</h2><p>Over the past few years, I’ve jumped between Apple Music and Spotify to try out of their user interfaces. Switching between the two is a huge pain because you have to manually transfer songs or pay for a service to programmatically do it for you with decidedly ok results. If you don’t want to switch because of a social or operating system tie in, be prepared to weather price increases or hardware lockouts.</p><p>Streaming isn’t anything special, either. Setting up your own streaming box isn’t more than an hour or two of work with a little bit of research. Why pay someone else in perpetuity to do it for you?</p><h2 id="custom-tags-and-art">Custom Tags and Art</h2><p>Because I spend so much time organizing and listening to music I’ve collected, I like to organize and tag it. If Spotify says an album is “Rock” but I think it’s “Classic Rock,” it shouldn’t be that hard to change a string somewhere. Why should a service I pay for restrict my organizational urges?</p><p>Sometimes I don’t like the ultra deluxe versions of albums with the 17th alternate take of a song, so I just stash extra files and retag the rest to make the original release. Sergeant Pepper’s album cover looks too saturated? Just download a different copy. Freedom over the medium should be the default.</p><h2 id="proper-ownership">Proper Ownership</h2><p>One thing that drove me crazy was Spotify just <em>removing</em> albums I liked inexplicably. I understand the licensing agreements exist, but it really sucks just having music disappear. If I pay someone monthly for something, I think it’s reasonable for it to be there month after month. Unless someone waltzes into my hard disk array and deletes things, it should be there in perpetuity. A win for preserving the arts how I’d like to.</p><p>I feel like there’s a lesson here about ownership in the modern age, and why it’s a right that should be vehemently defended against corporate incursions.</p></main><div class="dark-mode-buttons"><button class="dark-mode-button" id="dark-mode-on"><img alt="Dark mode" aria-label="dark mode toggle" title="Dark mode" height="24" src="https://www.mattnewcomer.org/dark_mode.svg" width="24"></button><button class="dark-mode-button" id="dark-mode-off"><img alt="Light mode" aria-label="light mode toggle" title="Light mode" height="24" src="https://www.mattnewcomer.org/light_mode.svg" width="24"></button></div><script>const cls = document.body.classList;
