This article is a summary of my experience ditching my old phone and moving to a credit card sized minimal phone.</p><h2 id="wait-why-did-i-sell-my-pocket-supercomputer">Wait, Why Did I Sell My Pocket Supercomputer?</h2><p>Like many other people my age, I grew up with a smart phone always within arm’s reach. I never really questioned why I needed such a device at such a young age because it was new and the cool thing to have. The first time I noticed that I disliked my smartphone was because it was become a crutch in way too many situations. By crutch, I mean a thing that you depend on to the point of reliance. Once I realized that I was beholden to the smartphone I started to notice other things.</p><p>iPhones have this cool feature where they record the amount of time you spend on your phone per day and in which apps you spend your time. On every Sunday(?) it sends you a notification to review your screen time and <em><strong>holy moly</strong></em> was I spending a lot of time doing mindless things. It wound up being like 4+ hours <em>per day</em> using my phone for absolutely no reason. Half of this number was me lackign the self control to put it down and do something else, but I’d also like to believe that the other half was these apps being so damn addictive. Bright colors, incessant notifications, my friends using them … all key ingredients on getting me to keep coming back. Strike 1 for the iPhone.</p><p>Smartphones also have this magical ability to stifle genuine social interactions. Imagine you’re out for a walk with a friend enjoying the weather. You’re both having a great conversation, but it slowly dies out and silence fills the space between both of you. Nothing else can disrupt the moment like the other person feeling the need to check Instagram or take a Snapchat. I find the feeling of having that moment tarnished extremely grating and I wanted to stop myself from ruining another one. Strike 2.</p><p>Finally, iPhones have blue bubbles to signal that you (yes, you!) are the proud owner of an Apple device. People my age like to grandstand against the dreaded green bubble because it’s “ugly” and “not blue”; I never realized colors were that important. People also criticize green bubbles for lower image quality and a smaller feature set, but if you’re talking to a friend does that <em>really</em> matter? For a multitude of reasons that I’ll skip for now, I don’t believe Apple should have a stranglehold on the U.S. smartphone market. If me switching to something else means I can keep my money away from Apple, I’ll do it. Strike 3, iPhone’s out.</p><p>Now that I was set on ditching my smartphone, started talking about it with friends, and they had some reasonable questions:</p><blockquote><p>Can’t you just turn off notifications and make your phone greyscale?</p></blockquote><p>Yes, I absolutely could have, but I lacked the self control to keep these settings enabled. And anyways, most apps you use are not designed for greyscale and come out looking like a cloudy sky instead of being usable.</p><blockquote><p>Screen time lets you limit time in apps. Why not enable that?</p></blockquote><p>I enabled it on apps like YouTube that were purely time wasters but I always bypassed the limit. Apps like Snapchat were a social “necessity” at the time so limiting them felt the same as deleting them.</p><blockquote><p>Isn’t it a lot of work to move everything over?</p></blockquote><p>Yes, and I fully acknowledged the amount of work, time, and money it would cost to move everything over to a new device. Once I realized the problems I had with my iPhone were deep rooted I was willing to invest that effort in to getting rid of it.</p><h2 id="what-did-i-consider-while-looking-for-a-new-device">What Did I Consider While Looking for a New Device?</h2><p>Not to sound like a sales pitch, but I settled on a few key things a new phone would have to do for it to be worth the effort. When I started the search, I knew I wanted a smaller phone that was the bare necessities only.</p><p><strong>Restrictiveness</strong>: The constraints imposed by the phone can’t be disabled. The features provided by the phone should be enough to keep me safe and in contact with friends and family. Not much else.</p><p><strong>Form Factor</strong>: The phone should be small enough to disappear into a pocket.</p><p><strong>Features</strong>: The phone should connect to the 4G cell network.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup> The phone shouldn’t be able to download apps or access the internet. Just texting and calling, please.</p><p><strong>Cost</strong>: Lower volume products are typically more expensive due to economies of scale not kicking in to the same extent. That said, I was hoping to pay less than $400 USD.</p><p><strong>Durability</strong>: Survives a few drops from waist height when I inevitably miss my pocket while in a hurry.</p><h2 id="so-what-did-i-buy">So What Did I Buy?</h2><p>I ended up settling on the <a href="https://www.thelightphone.com/" rel="noreferrer">Light Phone II</a>, a $299 USD smart phone with an e-ink display and not much else. The phone sells itself on being used as little as possible which manifests in the ethos of “going light.” This translates to not having social media, news, email, an internet browser, or feeds. Instead, you’re presented with small set of tools in a “toolbox” which is equivalent to a home screen:</p><figure><a href="https://www.thelightphone.com/"> <img alt="Sample screens of the Light Phone II on rotation" src="toolbox.gif" width="350"> </a><figcaption>Example screens from Light Phone II applications, credit The Light Phone Inc.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Each application has some quirks to it, but they’re all brutally simple:</strong></p><ul><li>Alarm <ul><li>Sets a single alarm which can be enabled or disabled.</li></ul></li><li>Calculator <ul><li>A four function calculator that does exactly what you’d expect.</li></ul></li><li>Directions <ul><li>A GPS-powered point-to-point route finder for walking, public transit, and driving.</li><li>Has rudimentary voice directions while driving.</li><li>Provides a GPS test utility to diagnose issues.</li></ul></li><li>Hotspot <ul><li>A WiFi network where and when you need one.</li></ul></li><li>Music <ul><li>Up to 1 GB of music files in a single playlist.</li><li>No streaming services, you manually upload files via a web interface.</li></ul></li><li>Notes <ul><li>Make audio recordings or type text notes.</li></ul></li><li>Phone <ul><li>Call, text and manage contacts.</li><li>Phone cannot display received images or navigate to received links, they go to your email.</li></ul></li><li>Podcast <ul><li>Subscribe to podcasts via the web interface.</li><li>Syncs when on WiFi, supports offline listening.</li></ul></li><li>Settings <ul><li>View diagnostic information and configure how the device acts.</li><li>Can set display to white or black background, matches phone color by default.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Some hardware features to note:</strong></p><ul><li>The phone has a 3.5mm headphone jack <ul><li><strong>ALL HAIL THE RETURN OF THE SUPERIOR CONNECTOR</strong><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup></li></ul></li><li>The phone lacks a camera</li><li>The phone charges via micro USB <ul><li>The worst USB is back, although workarounds exist.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#3">3</a></sup></li></ul></li><li>The phone has a small battery <ul><li>Compared to an iPhone’s ~3000 mAh battery, the Light Phone II has a measly 950 mAh by comparison.</li><li>Most of the phone’s energy is spent using its radios, so don’t expect stellar battery life compared to an iPhone.</li></ul></li><li>The phone screen is monochrome and is slow to refresh <ul><li>A limitation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_paper" rel="noreferrer">e-ink</a> is that is takes a while for the screen to display a new image.</li><li>The screen can “flicker” when it updates as it flashes between black and white to render text.</li><li>The phone looks best in full sunlight, though it has a backlight for use in dark environments.</li></ul></li><li>The phone has solid Wifi, Bluetooth, and cellular capabilities <ul><li>All three technologies work exactly as you’d expect without any issues that I’ve noticed.</li></ul></li><li>Most SMS features still work as you’d expect <ul><li>Group texting works exactly the same as on Android devices</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="how-was-it-getting-started-with-it">How Was It Getting Started With It?</h2><p>Not that bad.</p><p>The first issue I had to fix was the <a href="https://www.thelightphone.com/compatibility-checker" rel="noreferrer">limited cellular providers</a> that the phone is compatible with. My old plan was not going to be compatible with the phone, so I ended up porting my number to Mint Mobile where I got the cheapest plan I possibly could.</p><p>The second issue never really arrived.</p><p>Before my phone arrived, I noted down what I used my old phone for that I couldn’t do without. For example, I use it as a second factor to log into a university system. I still needed to do that, so I sidestepped the phone’s limitations by getting a hardware key that I physically plug into the computer I am using to authenticate myself.</p><p>Another issue is that the phone can’t really be used for multitasking. Although the phone has a notes app, talking on the phone and writing notes isn’t practical. I started carrying a notebook and pen so I can talk and record what I need. A fun side effect is that I always have a notebook on me and can doodle more often!</p><p>Surprisingly, my friends didn’t mind the green bubbles. It almost serves as a sort of litmus test to see if a person is caught up in the pointless brand rivalry; if someone made a point of picking on me over the color of the bubbles, maybe our priorities aren’t aligned.</p><p>The last thing of note is not having a camera. When people learn that the phone doesn’t have a camera, they typically give me a puzzled look and ask</p><blockquote><p>How do you take photos of stuff?</p></blockquote><p>Simple, I don’t. If it’s important, I write it down. If it’s beautiful, I admire then move on. I wish I had a camera to take photos from walks or hikes, but that’s for another time in the future.</p><p>It’s worth noting that all of the fixes I just mentioned are harder than just using a smartphone, but to me the difficulty is worth it. The calculus may not work out the same for you, and that’s alright.</p><h2 id="what-s-it-like-living-with-it">What’s It Like Living With It?</h2><p>Honestly, I just stopped noticing anything was different after the first month.</p><p><strong>Some things stayed the same:</strong></p><p>Like any other smartphone, nightly charging remained a part of my routine to keep it ready for the next day. I can consistently get a day and a half out of the phone before it needs to be recharged. The phone has a battery percentage indicator which is nice, but once I got used to how the battery drains I stopped looking at it.</p><p>My phone also comes with me pretty much anywhere I go, but I don’t check it nearly as often. I used to get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_vibration_syndrome" rel="noreferrer">phantom vibrations</a> which drove me to check my phone incessantly but now it’s just kinda “there” when I need it. I still listen to music when I ride the bus or am working around the house, but the limited variety I can store on my phone (as imposed by the 1GB size limit) pushes me to listen less often.</p><p><strong>Some things changed slowly over time:</strong></p><p>Texting on such a small screen is a <em><strong>chore</strong></em>. Getting a sentence or two takes a few tries which is fine, but in a pinch it can be a pain. The phone has a speech to text functionality which is pretty accurate, but punctuation really messes with it. My “workaround” if you want to call it that is just calling people. It’s become a regular highlight of my week to call my friends and parents to check in and catch up. Instead of conversations dragging out over hours through the day over text, I can call someone for 15 minutes in the afternoon or evening and have a much nicer conversation where I don’t have to constantly clarify what gets lost over text.</p><p>Because spotify just isn’t a thing on my phone, I ended up cancelling that subscription pretty early on. Every week or two I sit down for 15 to 30 minutes and pick a few albums and artists that I want to listen to. I gather all of the mp3’s and upload them to the web interface where they are compressed and downloaded to my phone. A little bit of playlist ordering and less than an hour later I have my playlist for the next little while ready to go.</p><p>I’ve also gotten used to telling people that images they send me will be seen “sometime later when I get to my computer.” I used to be the kind of person to fix issues as soon as they arose, but now “it can wait” has become a common saying when I’m out and about.</p><p>Lastly, telling people that I have a dumb phone and showing it to them elicits one of two reactions:</p><blockquote><p>Wow, that’s so cool. I’v been thinking about doing this too!</p></blockquote><p>or</p><blockquote><p>Why would you do this to yourself?</p></blockquote><p>It’s pretty much a 50/50 split between admiration and pity. I still don’t have a great response to either, but it’s cool to know that my actions aren’t on the fringes.</p><p>Overall, disconnecting from the supercomputer and moving to what I lovingly call “the brick” has been the impetus for a total mode shift on how I view and interact with technology.</p><h2 id="the-advantages">The Advantages</h2><p>First and foremost, I have hours more added back to my day that I would have otherwise spent doing mindless things. While I work on reports or projects I’m just not tempted to do stuff on my phone because there’s just nothing to do. What am I going to do on it, open the settings and mindlessly navigate the menus? I’d rather watch paint dry.</p><p>Furthermore, it just blends in. I have no desire to get a new phone because this one just works. I don’t have to fuss with store apps, new features, or anything that is on the cutting edge.</p><p>I don’t have anything else to say because <em>it just works</em>.</p><h2 id="the-disadvantages">The Disadvantages</h2><p>Not having a camera sucks at times. If I want a photo of something I have to ask someone with me to take it for me. 90% of the time this doesn’t cause any issues, but the remainder of the time I can miss what I wanted a photo of by the time I find someone.</p><p>Many organizations and businesses use QR codes so people can access links on their smartphones. Well, what if your phone doesn’t have a camera <strong>or</strong> a web browser? It requires getting creative, which can get annoying.</p><p>Micro USB is in a word, bad. It’s old, wears out easily, and goes in one way. There are workarounds, though.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#3">3</a></sup> There also aren’t that many of these in the wild, so the secondary market is still expensive and third party accessories are borderline non-existent. Software quirks still happen, but are infrequent and usually impact low priority things.</p><p>The most noticeable disadvantage (turn advantage?) is that you’re the person in the room bucking social norms. It’s fun to be different, but sometimes it’s weird being the odd one out.</p><h2 id="would-i-do-it-again">Would I Do It Again?</h2><p>Absolutely.</p><p>The extra time and mental headspace is worth the extra effort that is required to get things done. At first I viewed the change as a very un-scientific experiment, but now it’s just how I use my phone.</p><p>Without being too reductionist, I think phones are just boxes that should be used to communicate with other people. The Light Phone II fills this need for me perfectly plus a few “nice to haves.” It has melted into the background at this point to where I don’t have to think about it. I grab it in the morning, listen to some music, call my friends, text my parents, plug it in at night, and repeat tomorrow. I don’t think I want anything more or less.</p><p>The looks some people give me when they see my little brick phone in public are priceless, too.</p><hr><div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup><p>Many “feature phones” are restricted to 2G or 3G networks which are slowly being <a href="https://www.att.com/support/article/wireless/KM1324171" rel="noreferrer">phased out</a> across the country.</p></div><div class="footnote-definition" id="2"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">2</sup><p>It just works, it spins, it doesn’t need a battery.

This reduces port wear on the phone which increases its lifespan while allowing me to use the superior USB-C connector. No data is transferred via this port, so you don’t have to find a connector that does data in addition to power.</p></div></main><div class="dark-mode-buttons"><button class="dark-mode-button dark-mode-hide" id="dark-mode-disable-button"><img alt="Dark mode" aria-label="dark mode toggle" title="Dark mode" height="24" src="https://www.mattnewcomer.org/dark_mode.svg" width="24"></button><button class="dark-mode-button dark-mode-show" id="dark-mode-enable-button"><img alt="Light mode" aria-label="light mode toggle" title="Light mode" height="24" src="https://www.mattnewcomer.org/light_mode.svg" width="24"></button></div><script>const cls=document.body.classList;const getSessionTheme=sessionStorage.getItem("theme");if(getSessionTheme==="dark"){cls.toggle("dark-mode",true)}else if(getSessionTheme==="light"){cls.toggle("dark-mode",false)}else if(window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches){cls.toggle("dark-mode",true)};document.getElementById("dark-mode-disable-button").addEventListener("click",function(a){cls.toggle("dark-mode",true);sessionStorage.setItem("theme","dark")});document.getElementById("dark-mode-enable-button").addEventListener("click",function(a){cls.toggle("dark-mode",false);sessionStorage.setItem("theme","light")})</script><noscript><style>.dark-mode-buttons{display:none}</style></noscript></body></html>
