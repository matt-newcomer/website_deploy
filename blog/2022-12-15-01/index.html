I was exposed to baking by my grandmother’s breads and my mother’s cookies growing up. Although I never truly understood the skill that went into making such delicious food, I’ve started trying my hand at it.</p><h2 id="for-fun">For Fun?</h2><p>What’s more fun than making something delicious from scratch with your own two hands? Nothing really comes to mind.</p><p>Bread in its most simple form is <a href="https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/peasant-bread-recipe" rel="noreferrer">flour, water, salt, yeast, and sugar</a>, and it’s downright delicious. You really only need a bowl, a spoon, a pan, and some counter space to get started. Given those items, the only ingredient left is skill. Making a consistent loaf of bread requires skill and almost becomes like a game to best yourself each time you try. It’s a low stakes game that 99% of the time yields fresh food to enjoy. <em>That and your house smells <strong>amazing</strong> for 3-5 days afterwards.</em> What’s not to love?</p><p>Once you’ve mastered the basics, why not move on to more complicated recipes or different styles of baked goods? Cakes and pastries are a good stepping stone in difficulty. In return for the extra effort, you get a more complex dish to showcase your work. Breads are really versatile, but a fresh cake on a birthday or a pie for the holidays takes it up a notch.</p><p>Ultimately, the sky is the limit. Once you become familiar with the fundamental processes that power baking<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>, you can hone your own recipes or modify existing ones on the fly. That’s all to say that it’s really fulfilling and fun to bake something from scratch.</p><h2 id="for-profit">For Profit?</h2><p>When I say “profit,” I don’t mean financial gain; I take it to mean some material benefit or surplus that I create. Baked goods, bread in particular, have <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Baking?lang=en#Cultural_and_religious_significance" rel="noreferrer">cultural and religious significance</a> beyond just being a delicious food. In many Eastern European cultures, bread and salt are foods offered to guests when they arrive. Although I don’t subscribe to the religious beliefs, I acknowledge what bread represents and believe it can be more than just a staple food.</p><p>One of the activities I’ve made a habit out of recently is baking batches of bread for friends. Instead of buying something premade from the grocery store, I believe that the effort and skill required to make the bread represents the intent behind giving it to them more than the item itself. It’s my way of saying “I made this specifically for you, and I hope you enjoy it.” It’s often a physical way of expressing a feeling or sentiment that my words fail to.</p><p>The surplus from baking arises from the satisfaction I derive making and delivering it to my friend. Bonus points if I’m able to keep it a surprise. I think that my hobby sounds weird without context, but I genuinely derive a sense of satisfaction and closeness with my friends while giving them something to enjoy.</p><hr><div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup><p>Despite the age of the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/The_chemistry_of_breadmaking_%28IA_0276CHEM%29.pdf" rel="noreferrer">book</a>, pages 168-186 of the PDF do a fair job summarizing the chemical process of baking bread.</p></div></main><div class="dark-mode-buttons"><button class="dark-mode-button dark-mode-hide" id="dark-mode-disable-button"><img alt="Dark mode" aria-label="dark mode toggle" title="Dark mode" height="24" src="https://www.mattnewcomer.org/dark_mode.svg" width="24"></button><button class="dark-mode-button dark-mode-show" id="dark-mode-enable-button"><img alt="Light mode" aria-label="light mode toggle" title="Light mode" height="24" src="https://www.mattnewcomer.org/light_mode.svg" width="24"></button></div><script>const cls = document.body.classList;
