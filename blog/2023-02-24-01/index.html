Although the space called Wyoming has an elected government and is under the jurisdiction of the United States Federal Government, we propose that the state says “it’s all good” and dissolves itself into a legal gray area.</p><p>Our motive behind acquiring the 97,914 square miles is simple: to create a safe space where satirists can mock authority without fear of being arrested over hurt feelings and rash judgments.</p><p>Critics of <em>mattnewcomer.org</em> fear that handing over territory to a private entity creates a dangerous precedent wherein parts of the country are just given away, manifest destiny style. To these critics, we respond that manifest destiny never ended, and ownership is completely made up by people as a means of control.</p><p>Even if these critics have a legal backing for their position and our persuasion attempts fail, <em>mattnewcomer.org</em>’s readership of 20 million devoted fans can overpower the 250 people who call the state home. Newly-liberated and former residents of Wyoming can easily move due west to Idaho where they won’t even notice change.</p><p>The editor of <em>mattnewcomer.org</em> understands this manifesto may anger residents of Wyoming, and to them we say satire is really funny and taking over a state to protect it is a small price to pay. Those who wish to reach the editors of this publication can write a letter and address it to the nearest waste bin.</p><hr><p>The impetus for writing this piece was the Supreme Court’s denial of Anthony Novak’s petition to sue two police officers in the city of Parma, Ohio. His entire case is documented <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ij.org/case/novak-v-parma/#" target="_blank">here</a> by his legal team.</p><p>In response to the absurdity that is arresting someone for satire, <em>The Onion</em> wrote <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/22/22-293/242292/20221003125252896_35295545_1-22.10.03%20-%20Novak-Parma%20-%20Onion%20Amicus%20Brief.pdf" target="_blank">this masterpiece</a> of an Amicus brief. Why not make a point inside of a point while poking fun at the Supreme Court if you have the chance?</p></main><div class="dark-mode-buttons"><button class="dark-mode-button dark-mode-hide" id="dark-mode-disable-button"><img alt="Dark mode" aria-label="dark mode toggle" title="Dark mode" height="24" src="https://www.mattnewcomer.org/dark_mode.svg" width="24"></button><button class="dark-mode-button dark-mode-show" id="dark-mode-enable-button"><img alt="Light mode" aria-label="light mode toggle" title="Light mode" height="24" src="https://www.mattnewcomer.org/light_mode.svg" width="24"></button></div><script>const cls=document.body.classList;const getSessionTheme=sessionStorage.getItem("theme");if(getSessionTheme==="dark"){cls.toggle("dark-mode",true)}else if(getSessionTheme==="light"){cls.toggle("dark-mode",false)}else if(window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches){cls.toggle("dark-mode",true)};document.getElementById("dark-mode-disable-button").addEventListener("click",function(a){cls.toggle("dark-mode",true);sessionStorage.setItem("theme","dark")});document.getElementById("dark-mode-enable-button").addEventListener("click",function(a){cls.toggle("dark-mode",false);sessionStorage.setItem("theme","light")})</script><noscript><style>.dark-mode-buttons{display:none}</style></noscript></body></html>
