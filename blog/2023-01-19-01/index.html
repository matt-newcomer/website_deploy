I don’t really have a any music-making ability, but I really like listening. The Grado’s are fun, but there had to be more to experience. Why not try an industry veteran?</p><figure><a href="7506_headband_full.JPG"> <img alt="A pair of Sony MDR-7506 headphones with the headband focused reading studio monitor" src="7506_headband_mini.JPG" width="800"> </a><figcaption>Sony wants you to know one thing immediately</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.rtings.com/headphones/reviews/sony/mdr-7506" rel="noreferrer">rtings</a> describes these headphones as “[good] for neutral listening…[they] have a well-balanced sound with a punchy bass that doesn’t drown the excellent mid-range.” I couldn’t agree with that summary more. Be sure to check them out for a more <em>scientific</em> analysis.</p><p>A few key characteristics to note:</p><ul><li>Unlike the Grado’s that highlight a few instruments, the Sony’s just keep the bass in without muddying everything else.</li><li>Otherwise, the headphones just sound “flat”, as if you were standing in an anechoic chamber with the speaker pointed at you.</li></ul><p>It’s hard to really describe what these sound like; maybe some examples with elucidate my points:</p><ul><li>Daft Punk’s “Voyager” is dominated by a bassline that the Sony’s deliver without distorting the synth or electronic drums.</li><li>The Who’s “Eminence Front” features a guitar with some reverb, but unlike with open-back headphones, there is no extra noise beyond what is in the recording.</li><li>Frank Ocean’s “Pink + White” has a bass note, a violin-esque sound, and vocals layered simultaneously around the halfway mark. All three are perfectly clear and well balanced.</li></ul><p>Many of these changes are primarily driven by these headphones being closed-back. They inherently retain more bass, but without sounding boom-y. Pretty incredible for a pair of headphones with a party trick just waiting.</p><figure><a href="7506_folded_full.JPG"> <img alt="A pair of Sony MDR-7506 headphones folded sitting on a table" src="7506_folded_mini.JPG" width="800"> </a><figcaption>The hinges allow the ear cups to fold inside the headband</figcaption></figure><p>Because they’re closed-back, you can use them in public without other people hearing the “bad music” you’re listening to. Sony <em><strong>knew</strong></em> this and they fold to fit in a bag. They’re just too much fun to leave at home. They only take ~60Ω to drive, so mobile devices can do it with relative ease.</p><p>The plastic build with metal hinges is lightweight and exudes utility. The thinner earpads make your ears warm while allowing for the folding action. No fancy materials or artwork, just plastic and some labels. That said, they excel at more than music reproduction; they are super forgiving, too. The long coiled cable lets you walk around if using a stationary device to power them. The headband clicks into position for a consistent fit. No wonder these have stuck around for 30+ years.</p><figure><a href="7506_cord_view_full.JPG"> <img alt="A pair of Sony MDR-7506 headphones sitting on a table with the coiled cable in the foreground" src="7506_cord_view_mini.JPG" width="800"> </a><figcaption>The coiled cable is heavy and will pull on your head</figcaption></figure><p>Come to think of it, these are almost a perfect foil to the Grado’s. It’s amazing how different the same song can sound through two different pairs of headphones.</p></main><div class="dark-mode-buttons"><button class="dark-mode-button dark-mode-hide" id="dark-mode-disable-button"><img alt="Dark mode" aria-label="dark mode toggle" title="Dark mode" height="24" src="https://www.mattnewcomer.org/dark_mode.svg" width="24"></button><button class="dark-mode-button dark-mode-show" id="dark-mode-enable-button"><img alt="Light mode" aria-label="light mode toggle" title="Light mode" height="24" src="https://www.mattnewcomer.org/light_mode.svg" width="24"></button></div><script>const cls = document.body.classList;
