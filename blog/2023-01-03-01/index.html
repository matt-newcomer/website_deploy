I wanted to rock the boat a little to see what it did to me, so I decided to take a week to try the potato diet.<p>I originally learned about the diet from <a href=https://slimemoldtimemold.com/2022/04/29/potato-diet-community-trial-sign-up-now-lol/ rel=noreferrer>Slime Mold Time Mold</a>’s community trial. Just the prospect of eating one food exclusively was utterly fascinating; well that and I wanted to see what it would do to me. I’ve read about how food impacts your mental state in the past, but I never really noticed that change in myself. Maybe I’ve always eaten a “western” diet, maybe it’s a blind spot I have. Regardless, why not see what happens?<p>The ground rules are super simple:<ol><li>Eat potatoes<li>Eat as many potatoes as you want, but stop when you’re full<li>Try not to season them, but if you do, avoid dairy and keep the salt down</ol><h2 id=the-experience>The Experience</h2><p>The feeling of going to the store solely to buy potatoes is weird. To run my little experiment I got a 10lb bag of Russet, a 5lb bag of yellow, and a 1lb bag of mini red potatoes. I opted to bake the Russets and roast the yellows and mini reds because that’s how I’ve always prepared each type and just went with it.<p>Because you are only making potatoes, it’s easy to prep them in bulk. I just fired up the oven once and made roughly four days of food in roughly an hour. I did have to use every bowl I own to store all of the food I made… whoops.<p>For each of the seven days, I typically ate a late morning and early evening meal. The most I ate was on the last day when I had four Russets in one sitting for dinner. If you decide to do this yourself, you’ll quickly notice just how hard it is to eat potatoes quickly. Even when I tried, it took me five minutes or more to finish a single potato. The speed and the volume that the potatoes take up in your stomach seems to have made a situation where I couldn’t overeat. I guess the second rule above is self-enforcing.<p>As for the food, it’s like eating solid air. Potatoes are dense and utterly tasteless without garnishes or seasoning. After the first day, I slowly stopped caring. Instead of living to eat, my mindset shifted to one of eating to live. Potatoes are pretty much all carbs, and I experiences some weird after-meal energy spikes and crashes. This was the single hardest thing to overcome with respect to the diet. They became more pronounced as the week went on, but once I resumed a normal diet they went away. I suspect that a lack of protein was the root cause.<p>The second hardest thing about the diet was the social aspect. When my friends invited me out to lunch or some event had food, I just had to wait for potato time. I did slowly perfect the art of gently saying no without launching into a full story (which you’re reading now).<h2 id=takeaways>Takeaways</h2><p>Dear reader, I’d like to impress upon you how uneventful adhering to this diet is. You buy the potatoes, wash the potatoes, potentially cut the potatoes, you bake/roast/boil the potatoes, you enjoy the potatoes. Repeat weekly.<p>I genuinely had a good time just eating spuds. So much so that I want to do it again, but with two changes so it’s maintainable in the long term:<ul><li>I can eat a small piece of meat/can of beans every few days <ul><li>Fixes the hardest issue</ul><li>I can skip one meal per week to eat with friends <ul><li>Fixes the second hardest issue</ul></ul><p>I think my little experiment was a success; so much so that I want to do it for a few months. Let’s see how that goes.<p>Thank you, humble spud.</main><div class=dark-mode-buttons><button class="dark-mode-button dark-mode-hide" id=dark-mode-disable-button><img alt="Dark mode" aria-label="dark mode toggle" title="Dark mode" height=24 src=https://www.mattnewcomer.org/dark_mode.svg width=24></button><button class="dark-mode-button dark-mode-show" id=dark-mode-enable-button><img alt="Light mode" aria-label="light mode toggle" title="Light mode" height=24 src=https://www.mattnewcomer.org/light_mode.svg width=24></button></div><script>const cls = document.body.classList;
